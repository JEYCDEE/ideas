Hope I can help someone someday.
All my new ideas will be pushed here.

- remove-ds-files.py:
  - This little script can help you get rid of ._DS files on your macOS.

- set-created-date-for-photos.py:
  - This little script can help you organize your photo library by reading file date create and setting it as a file name, like 20180614_224000.jpg
  - Usage:
  	- Directory: python set-created-date-for-photos.py directory /path/to/media/directory
  	- File: python set-created-date-for-photos.py file /path/to/media/directory/image.jpg
